SNA Descritive Analysis from "Projeto Redes de Atenção às pessoas que consomem álcool e outras Drogas em Juiz de Fora-MG   Brazil"  - SNArRDJF

Here you can find a basic script to analysis data from SNArRDJF - this script was elaborated considering its use for orther matrix adjacency data from SNArRDJF - Here we are going to analyse:

# 21_CONFIANÇA D) Confia em compartilhar informações internas com este serviço. (var19) 

`#########################

`# Basic Preparation #####

`#########################

# Loading objects generated with 1.Principal.Rmd Script - Please run this script only after run 1.Principal.Rmd
```{r, echo=T, fig.height=12, fig.width=12, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rm(list = ls()) # removing previous objects to be sure that we don't have objects conflicts name
load("~/SNArRDJF/Robject/0_interactive_var19.RData")
```

```
##Reload packages
```{r, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE}
suppressMessages(library(RColorBrewer))
suppressMessages(library(car))
suppressMessages(library(xtable))
suppressMessages(library(igraph))
suppressMessages(library(miniCRAN))
suppressMessages(library(magrittr))
suppressMessages(library(keyplayer))
suppressMessages(library(dplyr))
suppressMessages(library(feather))
suppressMessages(library(visNetwork))
suppressMessages(library(knitr))
suppressMessages(library(DT))
```
##Adding phantom tools
```{r, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE}
#In order to get dinamic javascript object install those ones. If you get problems installing go to Stackoverflow.com and type your error to discover what to do. In some cases the libraries need to be intalled in outside R libs.
#devtools::install_github("wch/webshot")
#webshot::install_phantomjs()
```
##Setting a random seed - this is a good strategy to keep the same graph pattern layout in a new report generation
```{r, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE}
set.seed(123)
```

`#########################

`## Descriptive Analysis #

`#########################

##Simplify Graph - removing loops and duble edges 
```{r, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
var19<-simplify(var19) #Simplify
```
#Descriptive Analysis for 21_CONFIANÇA D) Confia em compartilhar informações internas com este serviço. (var19) 

##Vertices and Edges Number
```{r, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#1. Vertices and Edges Number
var19_vcount<-vcount(var19)
var19_ecount<-ecount(var19)
```
##Vertice Number
Each vertice represents a service - named as an actor in our network
```{r, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
vcount(var19)
```
##Edge Number
Each edge represents a connection between two services named as a tie
```{r, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ecount(var19)
```

#Density - The proportion of present edges from all possible edges in the network.
The density of a binary network is simply the proportion of all possible ties that are actually present.

For a valued network, density is defined as the sum of the ties divided by the number of possible ties (i.e. the ratio of all tie strength that is actually present to the number of possible ties).  

The density of a network may give us insights into such phenomena as the speed at which information diffuses among the nodes, and the extent to which actors have high levels of social capital and/or social constraint.


##Edge Density
The density of a graph is the ratio of the number of edges and the number of possible edges.
```{r, echo=T, fig.height=12, fig.width=12, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
edge_density_var19<-edge_density(var19) #The proportion of present edges from all possible edges in the network.
edge_density_var19
```
##Edge connectivity - Adhesion
The edge connectivity of a graph or two vertices, this is recently also called group adhesion.
```{r, echo=T, fig.height=12, fig.width=12, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
edge_connectivity(var19, source =NULL, target =NULL, checks = T) #source and target can be replaced - their are here just as default
```
###Adhesion example
In order to use this we need to call source and target using the number of each vertex instead of the name - type in R to get numbers

```{r, echo=T, fig.height=12, fig.width=12, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Names and numbers

# list all if you have no idea about services id
# V(var19)$name 

# list all three first (you can use c(1:3))
V(var19)$name[1]  # just as an example
V(var19)$name[2]  # just as an example
V(var19)$name[3]  # just as an example

# list by others id's
V(var19)$name[6]  # just as an example
V(var19)$name[150]  # just as an example
V(var19)$name[185]  # just as an example

```
##Edge Connectivity - "CAPS_AD"==3 and "UAPS RURAL Buiéié"==150
Point connection calculates the number of nodes that would have to be removed in order for one actor to no longer be able to reach another.  If there are many different pathways that connect two actors, they have high "connectivity" in the sense that there are multiple ways for a signal to reach from one to the other - lower number - worse resilience 

```{r, echo=T, fig.height=12, fig.width=12, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
edge_connectivity(var19, source =150, target =3, checks = T) 
```

#Vertex Connectivity - Group Cohesion

It is the minimum number of vertices needed to remove to make the graph not strongly connected. (If the graph is not strongly connected then this is zero.). The cohesion of a graph (as defined by White and Harary, see references), is the vertex connectivity of the graph. This is calculated by cohesion.

These three functions essentially calculate the same measure(s), more precisely vertex_connectivity is the most general, the other two are included only for the ease of using more descriptive function names.

```{r, echo=T, fig.height=12, fig.width=12, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
vertex_connectivity(var19, source = NULL, target = NULL, checks = TRUE)
```

##Cohesion example

In order to use this we need to call source and target using the number of each vertex instead of the name - type in R to get numbers - see example above for more details 

##Vertex Connectivity - "CRE_SOC_ CREAS Norte"==6 and "AJU_MUT_ Grupo A.A. Liberdade" ==185
Minimum number of vertices needed to remove to make the vertex not connected by any vertex - it leads an error in case of using two connected vertex 
```{r, echo=T, fig.height=12, fig.width=12, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
vertex_connectivity(var19, source =6, target =185, checks = T) 
```

#Saving objects with new variables and changes
```{r, echo=T, fig.height=12, fig.width=12, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
save.image("~/SNArRDJF/Robject/1_intro_var19.RData") 
```
